# covid19_report

Since 2019, COVID-19 has taken many people's lives and largely affected people's regular life routine. 

In this report, two questions are focused based on COVID-19 data from  January 2020 to January 2022. The first question is *which state has highest prevalence rate and which state has lowest prevalence rate since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic? Are there any differences when compared data in 2020 to 2021?* Such analysis is important because differences of severity in each state is an significant measurement of effectiveness of interventions; policies level and community level interventions launched in states with less severity may be applied to other states to reduce the severity of the spread of the disease.  

The second question is *whether the relationship between cases and deaths stays constant from from Janurary 2020 to December 2021?* This is correlation may illustrate the effectiveness of intervention to prevent death, understand the nature of COVID-19 virus, and predict potential mutation of the COVID-19 virus from the differences. 

This report would majorly focus on monthly incidence rate of COVID-19 cases in each US state to visualize the severity of such disease by month from January 2020 to January 2022 to address question 1. Also, potential correlation between number of cases and deaths would be illustrated by graphs to trace back the spread of the disease in the US.
